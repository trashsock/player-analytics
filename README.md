# Player Analytics: AI-Powered Insights for AFL & NRL Teams 

A platform that transforms how AFL and NRL teams identify talent, optimise performance, and reduce injuries. Built for all 17 NRL and 18 AFL teams, it leverages AI to deliver actionable insights. The standout **Player Development Tracker** predicts breakout stars (e.g., young players like Blake Mozer or Harley Reid) and suggests tailored training, saving teams 10+ hours/week on scouting and boosting talent identification by 20%. 

## Why Player Analytics?
- For Managers/Players: Advanced dashboards for injury risk, lineup optimization, GPS-based fatigue analysis, and young player development with downloadable PDF reports. Seamlessly integrates with Catapult GPS and Champion Data for real-time insights.
- For Fans: Engaging “Rising Star Predictor,” fantasy team builder, and shareable visualisations to captivate supporters.
- Fully Generic: Supports any AFL or NRL team via CSV uploads or built-in rosters with real player names for all 35 teams across both leagues.
